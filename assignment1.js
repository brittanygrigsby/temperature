// 1. Declare Variables
let character = "Billy";
let action = "ran after";
let object = "a big balloon";
let place = "his house";
let day = "a sunny Sunday";

// Using "const"
const event= "birthday party";

console. log("--- Funny Story ---");
console. log(character + " was at " + place + " on " + day + "."); console. log ("Suddenly, " + character + " saw " + object + " floating by and " + action + " it. ");
console. log("When he got closer, he saw it was a " + event + " and his friends were there waiting to sing Happy Birthday!");

// 3. Experiment with Different Values
console. log("--- Different Version of the Story ---");

// Change values to create a different story
character = "Jane";
action = "run towards";
object = "a bounce house";
place = "the park";
time = "a Monday evening";
